          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m 13 years old (my birthday is September 6 🎉) and I’m in seventh grade.  
            I love <strong>alpine ski racing</strong> and <strong>soccer</strong>, and I’m always working hard to improve.  
            I’m also a <strong>second-year U14 skier</strong>, which keeps me busy with training and races.  
          </p>

          <h2>Skiing</h2>
          <p>
            In the winter, I ski at <strong>Waterville Valley</strong> and attend  
            <strong>Waterville Valley Academy</strong>. Over Thanksgiving I travel to Colorado to ski,  
            and in the summer I train at <strong>Mt. Hood</strong>. Skiing is a huge part of my life,  
            and I love the feeling of flying down the mountain.  
          </p>

          <h2>Soccer</h2>
          <p>
            I play soccer for both school and club. I enjoy being part of a team, competing in games,  
            and always working to get faster and stronger.  
          </p>

          <h2>Family & Traditions</h2>
          <p>
            I live with my younger sister, and we always have fun together.  
            I also have a <strong>mini golden doodle named Milo 🐶</strong>, who is always making me smile.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Family traditions are really important to me. Every Christmas, we go to my grandparents’ house  
            on my mom’s side, and I get to spend time with my cousins (I usually babysit the younger ones).  
            Before Christmas, I always host a cookie-decorating party. On Easter, my parents hide eggs  
            for me and my sister to find before we open our baskets.

          <h2>Adventures</h2>
          <p>
            In the summer, I go to sleepaway camp, love visiting the beach, and travel with my family.  
            We’ve been to <strong>Greece, England, and Mexico</strong>, and next year we’re going to  
            <strong>Africa</strong>! Each summer we pick a new place to explore.
