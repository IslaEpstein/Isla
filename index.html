      <h2>About Me</h2>

      I‚Äôm also a <b>second-year U14 skier</b>, which keeps me busy with training and races.</p>

      <h2>Skiing</h2>
      <p>In the winter, I ski at <b>Waterville Valley</b> and attend <b>Waterville Valley Academy</b>. Over Thanksgiving I travel to Colorado to ski, 
      and in the summer I train at <b>Mt. Hood</b>. Skiing is a huge part of my life, and I love the feeling of flying down the mountain.</p>

  <h2>Family & Traditions</h2>
  <p>I have a younger sister, and we always have fun together. I also have a <b>mini golden doodle named Milo üê∂</b>, who is always making me smile.</p>
  <p>Family traditions are very important to me. Every Christmas, we go to my grandparents‚Äô house on my mom‚Äôs side, and I get to spend time with my cousins (I usually babysit the younger ones). 
  Before Christmas, I always host a cookie-decorating party. On Easter, my parents hide eggs for me and my sister to find before we open our baskets.</p>

      <h2>Adventures</h2>
      <p>In the summer, I go to sleepaway camp, love visiting the beach, and travel with my family. 
      We‚Äôve been to <b>Greece</b>, <b>England</b>, and <b>Mexico</b>, and next year we‚Äôre going to <b>Africa</b>! 
      Each summer we pick a new place to explore.</p>
