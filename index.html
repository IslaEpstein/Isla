        <h1>Hi, I'm Isla!</h1>
        <p>
          I’m passionate about <strong>alpine ski racing</strong> and <strong>soccer</strong>.  
          I ski at <strong>Waterville Valley</strong>, where I also go to school during the winter at  
          <strong>Waterville Valley Academy</strong>. In the summer, I ski at <strong>Mt. Hood</strong>,  
          and I’m a <strong>second-year U14</strong> skier. Over Thanksgiving, I usually head to Colorado to ski,  
          and at Christmas I go to my grandparents’ house on my mom’s side, where I get to see my family.  
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not skiing, I love going to the beach, spending time at sleepaway camp, or  
          traveling with my family — I’ve been to Greece, England, and Mexico, and next year we’re  
          going to Africa! Every summer we go on a family trip somewhere new.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of skiing, I play <strong>soccer</strong> for both school and club. I also babysit my baby cousins,  
          and I turned <strong>13 on September 6</strong>! 🎉 Before Christmas, I always have a  
          cookie-decorating party with friends, and on Easter my parents hide eggs for me and my sister to find  
          before we open our baskets.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a <strong>mini golden doodle named Milo 🐶</strong>, and I love spending time with him  
          and my younger sister. Being in seventh grade keeps me busy, but I’m always excited for the  
          adventures that come with school, sports, and family.
