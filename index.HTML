        <h1>Hi, I'm Isla!</h1>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm passionate about <strong>alpine ski racing</strong> and <strong>soccer</strong>.  
          I love competing, pushing myself to get faster, and being part of a team.  
          When I‚Äôm not racing down the slopes or playing soccer, I enjoy spending time with my 
          <strong>mini golden doodle named Milo üê∂</strong> and hanging out with my younger sister.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm always looking for ways to improve both in sports and in life. Whether it‚Äôs training, 
          learning new skills, or just having fun outdoors, I enjoy challenging myself.  
          My dream is to keep getting better at skiing and soccer while also enjoying the journey along the way.
